- Bug Fix: Source images are now set to 4096x4096 by default so that source images are always processed at actual size.

1.101 - Bug Fix: Fixed trim offset error when saving a Master Sprite without rebuilding atlases.

1.100 - Bug Fix: Fixed frame duplication bug in editor.

1.099 - Improvements:
- Changed the way Editor Properties default settings are handled. Now Sprites and Sprite Groups will inherit default setting changes as long as they are not overridden in the Sprite or Sprite Group.
- Added Default Material setting in Editor Properties.
- You can now upgrade Sprite Factory when the editor window is open. (It is still recommended you follow the Upgrading instructions in the documentation when upgrading.)

1.098 - Improvements:
- Added Sprite.SetAnimationStartedCallback to notify when an animation starts playback.
- Added Sprite.SetAnimationFinishedCallback to notify when an animation completes playback.
- Added Sprite.SetAnimationEndedCallback to notify when an animation ends playback.

1.097 - Improvements: Minor tweaks to real-time animation preview and frame editor to improve accuracy.

1.096 - Bug Fix: Fixed incorrect 1/2 pixel offset alignment issue introduced in 1.094.

- Fixed 1/2 pixel alignment issue on frames with odd dimensions.
- Fixed bug when adding a blank frame to an animation.
- Source images are now set to WrapMode.Clamp.
- Checks for changes to source images when saving a sprite and triggers atlas rebuild if any were changed.

1.093 - Improvements: 
- Reduced editor memory usage to help when working with hundreds of frames per sprite.
  - Changed data storage format for source images and atlases to use GUID strings.
  - Editor now loads animation frames only after an animation is selected.
- Changed atlas generator code to avoid Mono heap growing continuously until out of memory due to temporary allocations. 
- Atlas texture importer sets Sprite Import Mode to None even if editor default behavior mode is set to 2D. (Unity 4.3+)
- Added option to defer rebuilding atlases for Master Sprites and Sprite Groups when saving.

1.092 - Bug Fix: Fixed bug when flipping a sprite in the editor which caused generated child sprite planes to not be flipped properly.

1.087 - Bug fix: Fixed inspector repaint error when adding frames via drag-and-dropping textures in Unity 4.3.

1.086 - New Feature: Added Sorting Layer support in Unity 4.3+.

1.085 - Bug fix: Animation playback now smooths frame timings and skips frames to even out animation speed when framerate doesn't sync well with playback speed. Note: Frame events will still play even when frames are skipped.

1.084 - New Feature: BoxCollider2D now supported (Unity 4.3+ required). See the Colliders page for more details. 
- Minor bug fixes (import bug in Unity 4+, bug when inserting a new Animation)
- Upgrade Note: Sprite.GetCollider, Sprite.GetColliders, and Sprite.GetRigidbody have been changed. Any calls to these methods in your scripts must be changed to accept the new return types. This was done to add 2D collider support while maintaining Unity 3.5 compatibility.

1.083 - Unity 4.3 compatibility fix:
- Unity 4.3 now includes a Sprite class which clashes with the SpriteFactory.Sprite class unless the SpriteFactory namespace is explicitly typed before each Sprite reference. This introduced an error in one CS file which was fixed.
- Upgrade Notes: If you are upgrading from a version < 4.3 to 4.3, your scripts will have to be modified. Anywhere in your script you used the Sprite class, you must change all references to read SpriteFactory.Sprite to avoid clashes with Unity's built-in Sprite class.

1.082 - Bug Fixes: 
- Multiple colliders generated by a Sprite ignore collisions with each other as intended.

1.081 - Minor features added. 
- Editor: Added Show All Colliders option to allow display of multiple colliders simultaneously in the Frame Editor.

- Editor: Frame Editor now supports zooming (mouse wheel) and panning (right-click and drag).
- Added animation Loop Restart Frame in Sprite.
- Bugs Fixes: 
- Tooltips didn't show up properly in Unity 4+ due to a Unity bug. Unity's tooltip system has been replaced.
- Fixed error when clicking picker on object fields (Source Image, Source Material) or color fields in Unity 3.5.
- Upgrade Notes:
- The following files have been removed and can be deleted from your project after upgrade: 
- SpriteFactory/Internal/GUI/FrameEditorGrid.png
- SpriteFactory/Internal/GUI/overlay.png
- SpriteFactory/Internal/GUI/resolutiongate.png
- SpriteFactory/Internal/GUI/SpriteCameraSkin.guiskin
